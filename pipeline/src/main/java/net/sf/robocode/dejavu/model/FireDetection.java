 * realized fire power (the engine-clamped value the born bullet was given) and
 * a reconstructed {@link Bullet} built with the real {@code bulletId} so it
 * hashes and compares identically to the ground-truth bullet.

 * The fire power is the input to the downstream bullet-hit events (Step 4) and
